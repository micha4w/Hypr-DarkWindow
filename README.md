# Hypr-DarkWindow
Hyprland plugin that adds possibility to invert the color of specific windows.

## Configuration
Why use a config file if you can edit the source code directly? Check out `src/CustomRules.h`

*There's now a version which uses the config file and dispatchers on branch `config`*

## Installation
Confirmed not working on < v0.28.0
Wokrs on v0.28.0
```sh
make all && make load
```
